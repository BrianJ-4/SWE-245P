Testing Approach

To ensure that the web page works correctly for the majority of users, I would follow these steps:

    Test the website in multiple modern browsers, including Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.

    View the site on different types of devices such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones to make sure the layout displays correctly.

    Check the responsiveness of the design by resizing the browser window and using developer tools.

    Use browser developer tools to check for console errors, slow-loading elements, and layout issues.

    Test the website under different network speeds to confirm that images and resources load properly.
